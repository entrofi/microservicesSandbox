# Microservices SandBox Release Notes 
## Topic: Service Discovery and Registry
## Version: 1.1.0
## Content Summary
In order to achieve high availability in a production environment, a service needs to be deployed at least with two instances. When the number is under control as in most of the distributed SOA cases client-to-service or service-to service calls can be handled using pre-configured service location parameters. However, for a microservices-based application high availability for a service should be obtained without disturbing other parts of the application in principle.  Each service in a microservice environment may have different scalability requirements and because it's preferable to deploy microservices using containerization, location parameters for each candidate instance usually is not predefined. This means that each instance of a service must be discoverable somehow. Therefore in this release, we are going to explore service discovery and service registry automation alternatives.
